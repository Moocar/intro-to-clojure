Slides and code from my Intro to Clojure talk.

To build the chuck norris joke application, download [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen), the Clojure build tool. Then in this directory, run:

```
lein run 2
```

Where 2 is the number of jokes to retrieve. This will download all dependencies, compile, and then run the program

To start a repl, use

```
lein repl
```
